Welcome to my Web Designs

There are to proyects in "HTML_PAGES":

1) Curriculum
2) Pages

- "Curriculum" is basicaly my CV tranported into a Web Page. A SPA page which has all the things I consider important about myself that can be include in a CV. I must say is not update; I mean it will be frozen in time. I will continue learning and doing stuffs but I´m not going to put it in this CV proyect. 
There is a glitch repository where you can see it for yourself ---> https://patricio-cv.glitch.me/ 
Click on "Curriculum" and there you go.

I did it with: HTML5, Advanced CSS, JavaScript, Ajax and Bootstrap.

- "Pages" Is simply a few pages in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap that I did when I started in the programing world. I think it is a good idea and I like it. 

I hope you enjoy it and please I´m open to suggestions. 

Patricio
